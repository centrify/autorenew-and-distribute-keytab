# autorenew-and-distribute-keytab
automatically renew service account keytab (using adkeytab), and distribute to multiple other hosts 

# motivation
customers find the adkeytab utility useful to generate krb5.keytab for service accounts that may be used for application like Hadoop, MongoDB, Oracle, etc.

the problems remaining are
* change the password at interval
* distribute the new keytab to other hosts in the same cluster

# summary of solution
this demo uses [etcd](https://etcd.io) as the centerpiece of change notification.

see default configuration `/etc/etcd/my.etcd.yml`.
it is secured by TLS using the CA, certificate and private key generated by adclient auto-enrollment feature.
note, the certifacet template should have ...
>            X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
>               TLS Web Client Authentication, TLS Web Server Authentication
etcd can be set up in systemd to automatically start on host startup.

on hostA - this is where we generate and maintain the master copy of xxx.keytab (principal: xxx).
this is also where etcd runs.
this is because other client hosts have to be able to reach this host (by ssh) to get the updated xxx.keytab anyway.
this is where you will need to run `check_and_renewkeytab.sh`.
if can be set up in crontab to run once a day.

on hostB - these are the client hosts that will connect to etcd to _watch_ for changes, 
and run `scp` to hostA to get the updated the xxx.keytab.

etcd will maintain a key-value pair. 
the key being the file name (xxx.keytab), and value is the md5sum of the file (you can change it to sh56sum if you like).
hostA will update the key when it invokes adkeytab to change password, and update xxx.keytab with the new KVNO.
it will then `put` the etcd key.
hostB gets the notication, check md5sum to see if it indeed changed, and then proceed to use `scp` to get the updated xxx.keytab.

client side `watch_keytab.sh` on startup will check to make sure if has initial copy of xxx.keytab, and the etcdctl CLI that it needs.
`watch_keytab_update.sh` is invoked from within watch_keytab.sh.
watch_keytab.sh runs in infinite loop ... use ctl-c to break out.
it is intended to be setup as systemd service to be started on system startup as well. 

# other notes
* `check_and_renew_keytab.sh` embeds a python call. it will need module "dateutil". do `pip3 install python-dateutil` to get it
* regarding xxx.keytab. on AD, check to make sure service account "xxx" has permission to allow it to `change password` and `reset password` by `SELF`.
* regarding the private key used by the shell scripts, and etcd, make sure it is readable by the invocation process. by default, it is only readable by root.

# testing
* `check_and_renew_keytab.sh` allows paramater "mm/dd/yy" to sumilate a future date. otherwise, it will only initiate change after 28 days.
* `check_and_renew_keytab.sh` allows 2nd parameter (any string) to simulate invocation adkeytab to change password.
* `watch_keytab.sh` allows for any parameter (any string) to simulate remote file changed (thus to invoke scp).
